# SistemaSolar

This project is a simple Solar System simulation worte in C++ and the open source library OpenGL for 3D graphics. We wrote basic functionalities to the program like camara manipulation, lighting source and texture integration. The Solar System simulation consist of the 8 planets, the sun and Pluto. 

It is worth mentioning that the present work is limited to simulating the basic planet movement of the Solar System, and that this exercise does not use a precise elliptical simulation or the actual movement of each of the planets (based on stellar equations or other). It remains for future work to implement it in the project.

## Getting Started

Download by clicking the download button or clone the Github repertory using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Guetop/SistemaSolar.git
```

### Prerequisites

You need the following sets of libraries and programs in your local computer:

- [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started)
- [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)

### Running

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Navigate to the folder and run the following command to create the execution file (This command works for OSX and LINUX, it may not work for Windows):

```
$ make
```

It may show some warning messages of deprecated functions.

Run the program:

```
$ ./solarSis
```

### Example

## Built With

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - 3D graphics
- [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) - provides support to interact with the Operating System and building models.
